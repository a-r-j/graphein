Welcome to Graphein's documentation!
====================================
This package provides functionality for producing a number of types of graph-based representations of proteins. We provide compatibility with standard formats, as well as graph objects designed for ease of use with popular deep learning libraries.

.. note::
   This is an early-stage project and a lot more documentation and functionality is planned to be included. If you are a structural biologist or machine learning researcher in computational biology, my inbox is always open for suggestions and assistance!
