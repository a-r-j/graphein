Graphein
========

Graphein  is  a  python  library  for  constructing graph   and   surface-mesh   representations   of protein  structures  for  computational  analysis. The  library  interfaces  with  popular  geometric deep learning libraries: `DGL <https://www.dgl.ai/>`_ (and `DGL-LifeSci <https://lifesci.dgl.ai/>`_), `PyTorch Geometric <https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and `PyTorch3D <https://pytorch3d.org/>`_.

As feature engineering is a vital step in a machine learning project, the library is designed to be highly flexible, allowing the user to parameterise the graph construction, scalable to facilitate working with large protein complexes,and containing useful pre-processing tools  for preparing experimental structure files. Graphein is also designed to facilitate network-based and graph-theoretic  analyses  of  protein  structures in  a  high-throughput  manner.
